# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions for [AoC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) in Python. Various utility functions can be found in util/advent.py.

### A Note
All of the code was written at 6 AM because of the timezone difference so forgive the horrible code. I was too lazy to refactor most of the time.
